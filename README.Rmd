# greenfeedR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of greenfeedR is to provide convenient functions to process GreenFeed files

## Installation

You can install the development version of greenfeedR from [GitHub](https://github.com/GMBog/greenfeedR) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("GMBog/greenfeedR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(greenfeedR)
User = "your_username"
Pass = "your_password"

Exp = "Test"
Unit = "212"
Start_Date = "2024-07-15"
End_Date = Sys.Date()
Dir = "/Users/Downloads"
RFID_file = "/Users/Test_RFID.csv"


#dailyrep(User, Pass, Exp, Unit, Start_Date, End_Date, Dir, RFID_file)

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
